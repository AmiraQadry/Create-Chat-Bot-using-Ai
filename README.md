1. Set up the software environment to create an AI chatbot. You will need Python, Pip, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), an OpenAI API key, and a code editor.
2. Install the required libraries and upgrade Pip.
3. Get the OpenAI API key for free.
4. Build your own AI chatbot with ChatGPT API.
5. Define a function to generate a response using GPT-3.5
6. "The generate_response function sends the user's input as a prompt to the GPT-3.5 language model using the OpenAI API. The model then generates a response, which is extracted from the API response and returned."

### Note:
Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key for this code to work.
